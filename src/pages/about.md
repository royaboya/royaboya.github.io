I'm Roy, a second year studying Cybersecurity at Northeastern. 

On this site, you'll mainly find stuff related to what I'm learning, personal projects, things I'm participating in, and perhaps even some CTFs that I'm slowly getting more accustomed to.

Currently I'm interested in: CTF challenges, SecOps, and anything blue-team related, pentesting perhaps one day.
